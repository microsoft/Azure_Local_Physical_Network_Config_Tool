## How to File Issues and Get Help

This project uses [GitHub Issues](../../issues) to track bugs and feature requests.
Please search the existing issues before filing new ones to avoid duplicates.

For **bug reports**, include:
- The input JSON (redacted if needed) and the command you ran
- The full error output
- Your Python version (`python --version`) or binary version (`./network_config_generator -h`)

For **feature requests**, describe the use case and expected behaviour.

For **config submissions** (sharing validated switch configs), use the
[Config Submission](../../issues/new?template=config-submission.yml) issue template.
