        ## Thank you for contributing! 🎉
        
        By submitting your working switch configuration, you're helping the community expand vendor support for Azure Local physical network deployments.
        
        **Important:**
        - Your config will be automatically sanitized (passwords, IPs, hostnames removed)
        - Please review your submission to ensure no sensitive data remains
        - Configs must be from working Azure Local deployments
